# weather-app
[Weather app](https://celinediaz.github.io/weather-app/) done as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. This project had me learn how to use APIs. I also used a linter for the first time.
The API used was the [OpenWeatherApp API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
The app lets the user submit a city and it shows them the current weather and the weather for the next 4 hours. It also supports the metric and imperial system.
